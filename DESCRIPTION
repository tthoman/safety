Description: Provides a risk matrix function to assist with system safety risk assessment.
The riskmatrix() function within the safety package enables users to plot hazard data
upon an interactive risk matrix backdrop for risk visualization. Text boxes of risk 
parameters appear when hovered over. Visualizing the risk data enables users to thoroughly 
understand the risk of the system and prioritize risk mitigation and prevention. 
Risk is defined as the cross-section of worst-case severity of outcome and 
probability of occurrence within a specified interval of time.
